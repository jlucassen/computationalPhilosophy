PHILOSOPHICAL DOCUMENTATION

Here I will lay out how each of these experiments was supposed to function as as
philosophical tool. What I wanted to learn, what I actually learned, further
questions, sources of inspiration, and other notes on things like that. 
Experiments will be listed alphabetically, and rambled about in relentless
paragraphs.

3body
    Started this after reading Cixin Liu's book The Three Body Problem. Goal
    was to explore the three-body problem and chaos in general, not with a
    specific question in mind but just to understand it better and see where
    my thinking took me as the project progressed. After making nBody and 
    nBodyParallel, I had a pretty good way to visualize how tiny perturbances
    could make the whole system diverge over time. To try and get more insight,
    I then started looking for alternative visualizations. The goal of 
    threeBodyPlus's plane and norm modes were to explore whether the problem
    could be compressed into two dimensions, since all three bodies and their
    center of mass are always coplanar. I think the answer to that is probably
    "no" - the norm mode is pretty incomprehensible. With plotDivergence, I 
    wanted to play with phase space a little and also quantitatively visualize
    the divergence of the system. The divergence is, of course, also irregular
    and chaotic, and seems prone to sudden explosions (usually ejecting bodies)
    as well as stable (even smooth!) periods. Interesting connection to 
    Nassim Nicholas Taleb's work - these explosions are analogous to Black
    Swans, but don't just occur when the perturbed system unexpectedly ejects
    a body, but also when the original system ejects a body and the perturbed
    system fails to. Black Swans occur both when something unexpected happens
    or something expected fails to happen. During this project I came up with
    an idea for "honing" a chaotic system, but I'll have to try it out in a 
    less computationally intensive system, like the Lorenz equations.

evoSim
    This was my second project of this type, inspired by the research proposal
    I put together to apply to a summer fellowship at the Future of Humanity
    Institute, and heavily based on the model of evolution we worked with in 
    Bio 52 at Mudd. The original goal was to understand evolution better, and
    to see if references classes besides "existence" could show similar
    behavior. I think I do now understand evolution better, so we achieved that
    goal. Let me explain the second goal a bit more - in high school, I was
    being existential and angsty, and was looking to biology for some idea of a
    meaning to life that would be "based on science". I thought it was
    interesting how every living organism has this "goal" of surviving, and how
    that goal seems to arise necessarily from logic. If a given pattern is good
    at self-replicating, we'll observe it when we look around (at all existing
    things). If a pattern has some other goal, like crochet or suicide, we 
    won't observe it, since we don't observe things that aren't good at
    existing. I've since moved on from the existentialist side of this idea,
    which is pretty hopelessly pseudoscientific. But the idea is still
    interesting - what if we focus our attention on a specific class other than
    all things that exist? Could a similar effect take place? This could have
    important consequences, since we do care about the what compositions of
    classes besides all humans look like in the future, such as the class of
    wealthy or powerful humans. Would they evolve to tend towards hoarding
    wealth or power by this weird trait-amplifying effect? Turns out, no. The
    class of existence is special. In order to display a selection effect, a
    class needs a way to permanently exclude low genes, which will amplify the
    high ones as a result. However, failing to crochet or maintain power/wealth
    doesn't preclude the rest of your genetic line from ever doing so again,
    while failing to survive makes it impossible that a descendant of yours
    will survive successfully (really, I'm bundling "survive and reproduce"
    into the word "survive"). As a result, we don't have to worry about the
    rich and powerful of the deep future of humanity selecting to become brutal
    and power-hungry by some inevitable evolutionary force. Another takeaway is
    that many of the exact details of how you produce a selection effect within
    some system are superfluous - the key is some way to Permanently eliminate
    unfit individuals.

reverseBabel   
    This one was actually part of my final research project for History of
    Literacy Technologies. The goal was to evaluate a thought experiment 
    outlined by Jorge Luis Borges in The Library of Babel, in which he suggests
    that two people might fail to communicate without knowing it if they speak
    different languages that use the same symbols, and just happen to line up
    the right way. This simulation was designed to evaluate approximately how
    unlikely something like this would actually be (hint: ~0.08%). This was
    actually really interesting to make, as I had to figure out how empirical
    vs ground-up I wanted to be. The heart of this, generateCorpus, hinges on
    an interesting observation made by Benoit Mandelbrot - the Zipf
    distribution of natural language arises naturally in random corpora that
    are generated a certain way! This allowed me to significantly cut down on
    the empirical data necessary, since otherwise I would've had to use an
    empirical letter distribution, word length distribution, and word frequency
    distribution, which would basically amount to multiplying a bunch of curves
    together but would require some really weird mapping. I much prefer this
    method. Ultimately, the simulation confirmed my intuition that Borges'
    thought experiment would be extremely unlikely (even missing several
    important filters, like grammar and content!), and allows us to resolve the
    problem it poses for the rational integrity of language, at the cost of
    viewing language as heuristic rather than a pure Platonic activity. This
    turns out to be the starting point for a series of recontextualizations of
    language, however, which ultimately pose some really interesting questions
    about the foundations of human rationality. Really enjoyed this project.

sdSim
    Aimed to understand the COVID-19 pandemic a little better, and learn some
    epidemiology along the way. In particular, wanted to consider the risk of
    a second wave of infections as social distancing relaxes, due to the steppy
    and delayed nature of social distancing policy reactions. After running
    some sims to account for the disease itself (SEIR and SEIRD), and social
    distancing in both idealized and more realistic forms (SEIRD_sd, with lag
    and step modes), this worry of a second wave seemed largely immaterial.
    Oscillations on the way down like I was imagining require some really
    extreme parameters, and the real life lag and steppiness are bad, but 
    nowhere near that bad.
